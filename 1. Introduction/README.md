# Introducction

## Variables and Data Types
In Java, we use variables to store data. Each variable has an associated data type of values it can hold:
- Integers (int)
- Decimals (double, float)
- Text Strings (String)
- Characteres (char)
- Booleans (boolean)

## Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Some common operatiors include:
- Arithmetic: Addition (+), subtraction(-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulo (%).
- Comparison: Equality (==), inequality (!=), greater that (>), less that (<).
- Logical: And (&&), or (||), not (!).

## Control Structures
Control structures allow us tu control the flow of execution of a program. Some common control structures are:
- if-else: used to make decisions based on a condition.
- for: used to iterate over a sequence of elements.
- while: used to repeat a code while a condition is true.
- switch: used to make decisions based on multiple options.

## Methods
Methods allow us to encapsulete blocks of code that perform a specific task.

# Exceptions
Exceptions and errors are unexpected or exceptional events that occur during the execution of a Java program.
Exceptions are divided into checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions must be declared in the method signature or handled using try-catch blocks, while unchecked exceptions (runtime exceptions) do not require such handling.

## Custom Exceptions
Java allows developers to define custom exception classes to handle specific error conditions in their applications.
Custom exceptions are created by extending the Exception class or one of its subclasses.
Custom exceptions can provide additional information about the error condition and allow for more meaningful error handling in the application.

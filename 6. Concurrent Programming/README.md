# Concurrent and Parallel Programming
Concurrent programming in Java refers to the ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Threads in Java are the primary way to achieve concurrency. A thread represents an independent unit of execution that can perform operations concurrently with other threads.
In Java, you can create threads by either extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.

## Synchronization
Synchronization is crucial when multiple threads access shared resources to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency. In Java, you can synchronize code blocks using keywords like synchronized.

- Locks: represented by the Lock interface, allow greater control over synchronization by providing explicit methods for locking and unlocking shared resources.
- Semaphores: represented by the Semaphore class, are a more general construct that allows controlling access to a shared resource by acquiring and releasing permits.

# Networking Proggramming

## Socket Programming
Socket programming involves creating network communication between processes running on different machines. Sockets provide a mechanism for processes to communicate with each other, either on the same machine or across a network.

## Client-Server Communication
Client-server communication is a common networking pattern where one program acts as a client, initiating requests, and another program acts as a server, responding to those requests. This model enables distributed computing and facilitates various network-based applications.

## Network Protocols
It allow communnication on the internet.

- TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Offers faster but less reliable communication without establishing a connection.

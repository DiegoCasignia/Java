# Object-Oriented Programming
The Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.

## Inheritance
Allows a class to inherit fields and methods from another class.
> For example in CalculateArea, we have the classes Circle and Rectangle that inherit from the abstract class Shape

## Polymorphism
Allows an object to behave differently depending on the context. It can be achieved througth the use of overridden methods (override) and overloaded methods (overload).
> For example in CalculateArea, the polymorphism is achieved by calling the calculateArea() method

## Encapsulation
Allow us to hide the implementation details of an object. It can be archieved througtn the use of getters and setters.
> For example in CalculateArea, we have the classes Circle and Rectangle with private variables.

## Abstract Classes
Provide a common base for subclasses by defining abstract methods that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.
> For example in CalculateArea, we have abstract class Shape.

## Interfaces
An interface in Java serves to define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that uses it.
